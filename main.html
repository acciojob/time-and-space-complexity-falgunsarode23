	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute. It provides us with insights into how the algorithm's performance scales with the size of the input. A more efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, allowing it to process larger inputs in less time.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity is another critical aspect of algorithm analysis. It measures the amount of memory or space an algorithm requires to perform its task. Space complexity is often denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. It's important to manage space efficiently to ensure an algorithm can run on systems with limited memory resources. <b>Space Complexity</b> is particularly important when working with large datasets or on memory-constrained devices.</p>
